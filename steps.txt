https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html:
npx create-react-app feedback-app --use-npm
cd feedback-app
git init
*create repo on github*
git remote add origin https://github.com/levi-blodgett/feedback-app.git
git add .; git commit -m "init repo"; git push -u origin master;
Update readme.md
Delete feedback-app/src directory so we can recreate it from scratch
Create new src directory
Add index.js file
     Will be the main file used for putting together components for the SPA (single page application)
     Since React is made of components, we need to make each component and then use render to insert it into the DOM directly, creating a much more organized app structure
Create first component, app.js
    Components can be either classes or functions, classes is the older method for components, with more modern react components you will see hooks to use state and lifecycle
    We want to return jsx, JavaScript XML, syntax extension that allows us to have syntactic sugar to put HTML directly into our JavaScript
